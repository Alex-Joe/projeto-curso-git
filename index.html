		 <p>The Importance Of English: Although the English language doesn’t have the largest number of native speakers
		 in the world, it has the widest reach of any language spoken today. Both native and second-language speakers of
		 English are found on every continent, and English has become the lingua franca in many fields, including
		 business, politics, science, technology, and entertainment, to name a few. English is the working language 
		 of many international organizations, like NATO and the European Union, and it’s the language of global advertising.
		 It is also the most-used language of the internet, accounting for more than half of all websites. For many people,
		 learning English is a way to get access to a broader range of information, connections, and opportunities.
		 The importance of English is clear. </p>
